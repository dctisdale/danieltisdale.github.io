I'm a recent Masterâ€™s graduate from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, specializing in computer vision and machine learning. My thesis was on developing the first webcam eye-tracker for remote health assessments. I'm passionate about advancing Human-Computer Interaction, and am eager to leverage my skills to make computer vision and machine learning tools more accessible and helpful for people.
