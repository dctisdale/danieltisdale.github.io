excerpt: 'Abstract: We demonstrate a prototype that integrates automated eye gaze tracking into an already existing multimodal conversational platform for remote patient assessment and monitoring (NEMSI; short for “NEurological and Mental health Screening Instrument”). The platform engages patients in aninteractive dialog ses-
sion and guides patients through several spoken, orofacial, cognitive, and gaze tasks
inspired by clinical protocols. Novel additions to the dialog protocol include a se-
lection of exercises that have been widely used in oculomotor pathology research
as well as clinical practice, including: smooth pursuit, saccade, free image explo-
ration, directed image exploration, and the congruent and incongruent Stroop tests.
Furthermore, the prototype automatically computes eye-gaze metrics in addition to
speech, facial, linguistic, and motoric metrics relevant to the assessment of their
overall neurological and mental health. Finally, we report on internal testing to val-
idate the accuracy of real-time eye gaze software and metrics shown to be of use in
clinical research.'
