I'm a recent Masterâ€™s graduate from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, specializing in computer vision and machine learning. My thesis was on developing the first webcam eye-tracker for remote health assessments. I'm passionate about advancing Human-Computer Interaction, and am eager to leverage my skills to make computer vision and machine learning tools more accessible and helpful for people.

Short Bio: 
======

Daniel is a Thai-American who grew up in Chiang Mai, Thailand and moved to California in 2017 to pursue his passion in Computer Science at Cal Poly, SLO. He gained a M.S. and B.S. Computer Science degree under the blended program in 2024. During his master's degree he pursued many machine learning projects in the realm of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, his culminating thesis for his degree combined his two areas of interest under a collaboration with Modality AI to build the first webcam-based eye-tracker for remote health assessments in a multimodal setting which involved video, audio, and text analysis. Under this project, he has presented his work at conferences such as: AAAI (pending) and IWSDS (ACM) as well as work on establishing two patents in the space.
